Text Generation using Markov Chains

This project demonstrates text generation using Markov Chains, a probabilistic model that generates text based on the likelihood of word sequences derived from a given dataset.
The task focuses on understanding how simple statistical models can be used to generate meaningful text by learning patterns from existing data.


Task Description:

The objective of this task is to implement text generation using Markov Chain principles, where the next word is predicted based on the previous word(s) and their transition probabilities.


What Was Done:

Studied the basics of Markov Chains
Prepared a text dataset for training
Built a Markov Chain model from the dataset
Generated new text based on learned word transitions
Observed and verified the generated text output


Technologies Used:

Python
Markov Chain Model
Basic Natural Language Processing concepts


Output:

The model successfully generates text sequences that follow the patterns and structure of the training data, demonstrating the working of Markov Chain–based text generation.
